The suggested method constitutes an innovation in the field of Machine Learning in Health as it is based on the benefits of Convolutional Neural Networks that are traditionally used in Image Processing. The use of this network seems to utilize the correlation of input data for sample classification, i.e. the data is processed before entering the network to determine a data input sequence that ensures this correlation. The aim of this study was to examine whether Convolutional Neural Networks can be used as a tool for the analysis of transcriptomic data. The accuracy of the model was tested through the processing of different datasets. Models of Convolutional Neural Networks with differences in their architectural structure were developed to find the optimal performance in the classification of patients and control group
